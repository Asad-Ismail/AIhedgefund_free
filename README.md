# AI Hedge Fund Free

###  Original Repo Credit
This is an enhanced fork of the original (AIHedgeFund)[https://github.com/virattt/ai-hedge-fund.git] Check out the original repo and full credit goes to the original author and contributors. 

This fork adds


1. GPT4free to the original implemntation because most people cannot pay for apis for testing and educational purposes, so the idea is to make it useful for as many people as possible.


2. Better json error handling using json_repair generated by llms as llms have problems generating exact json if we are not usiong json mode which is not available in all models


### Usage

```bash

git clone https://github.com/Asad-Ismail/AIhedgefund_free

cd AIhedgefund_free
# install Poetry
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
poetry install 
## Run
poetry run/python src/main.py  --ticker AAPL,MSFT,NVDA ----gpt4free 

```

```bash

poetry run python src/main.py --ticker AAPL --show-agent-graph --gpt4free

# To test if gpt4 free is working
poetry run python -m tests.test_gpt4free


## Gemini also provide a free tier but has strict Rate limit, by backing off the request to 1 minutes we can avoid that but is a bit slow, put gemini key in .env file and run below

poetry run python src/main.py --ticker AAPL --show-agent-graph 


```
